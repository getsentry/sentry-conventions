## Deprecated Attributes

These attributes are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use the recommended replacements.

### ai.frequency_penalty

Used to reduce repetitiveness of generated tokens. The higher the value, the stronger a penalty is applied to previously present tokens, proportional to how many times they have already appeared in the prompt or prior generation.

| Has PII | false |
| Exists in OpenTelemetry | No |

| Deprecated | Yes, use `gen_ai.request.frequency_penalty` instead |

### ai.presence_penalty

Used to reduce repetitiveness of generated tokens. Similar to frequency_penalty, except that this penalty is applied equally to all tokens that have already appeared, regardless of their exact frequencies.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `double` |
| Has PII | false |
| Exists in OpenTelemetry | No |
| Example | `0.5` |
| Deprecated | Yes, use `gen_ai.request.presence_penalty` instead |

### ai.seed

The seed, ideally models given the same seed and same other parameters will produce the exact same output.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `string` |
| Has PII | false |
| Exists in OpenTelemetry | No |
| Example | `1234567890` |
| Deprecated | Yes, use `gen_ai.request.seed` instead |

### ai.temperature

For an AI model call, the temperature parameter. Temperature essentially means how random the output will be.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `double` |
| Has PII | false |
| Exists in OpenTelemetry | No |
| Example | `0.1` |
| Deprecated | Yes, use `gen_ai.request.temperature` instead |

### ai.top_k

Limits the model to only consider the K most likely next tokens, where K is an integer (e.g., top_k=20 means only the 20 highest probability tokens are considered).

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `integer` |
| Has PII | false |
| Exists in OpenTelemetry | No |
| Example | `35` |
| Deprecated | Yes, use `gen_ai.request.top_k` instead |

### ai.top_p

Limits the model to only consider tokens whose cumulative probability mass adds up to p, where p is a float between 0 and 1 (e.g., top_p=0.7 means only tokens that sum up to 70% of the probability mass are considered).

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `double` |
| Has PII | false |
| Exists in OpenTelemetry | No |
| Example | `0.7` |
| Deprecated | Yes, use `gen_ai.request.top_p` instead |
